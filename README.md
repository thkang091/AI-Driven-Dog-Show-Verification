# AI-Driven-Dog-Show-Verification

#Advanced a citywide dog show registration system using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models and Python to verify dog images and identify non-dog images, aiding global dog shows with over 18,000 competitors annually. Utilized PyTorch for model evaluation and fine-tuning, and set up TensorFlow environments to overcome limitations of pre-trained CNNs, enhancing accurate dog breed identification, verification classification results, and image label processing.
